# landfix_wHudAndCookies
Modified Landfix plugin that saves players settings and has a cutomizable HUD.   
Cherry's landfix has been deprecated as well, since it's not really reliable and unnecessary. Haze's landfix will be used instead.   
If you still want to have /landfixtype just register the commands for Command_LandFixType and it'll work.   

Special thanks to lukah for making the hud color system and menus.   

## Commands    
/lf - Enable/Disable Landfix    
/lfhud - Enable/Disable Landfix Hud    
/lfhudpos <number> - Change Hud Position (0-2) (Position 1 will not work if you're using "hud emo")        
/lfhudcolor <number> - Change Hud Color (0-5)    
/lfmenu - Open Landfix Menu
